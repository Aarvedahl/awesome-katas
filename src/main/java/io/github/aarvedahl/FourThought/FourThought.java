package io.github.aarvedahl.FourThought;/*
Input
Input begins with an integer 1≤m≤1000, indicating the number of test cases that follow. Each of the next m lines contain exactly one integer value for n in the range −1000000≤n≤1000000.
 */

/*
Output
For each test case print one line of output containing either an equation using four 4’s to reach the target number or the phrase no solution.
Print the equation following the format of the sample output; use spaces to separate the numbers and symbols printed. If there is more than one such equation which evaluates to the target integer, print any one of them.
